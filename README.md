# Extreme Tic Tac Toe

This bot was built by me and [Shreyas Shankar](https://github.com/shreyks) as a part of our Artificial Intelligence course at IIIT-H. It took part in a tournament of Extreme Tic Tac Toe and placed fourth among 80 teams. 

### Rules of Extreme Tic Tac Toe:
- Refer to the file [Description.pdf](https://github.com/swetanjal/Extreme-Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/master/Description.pdf) for the detailed rules of this game which is a modified and harder version of the classical game of Tic Tac Toe.

### Code Structure:
- Our code is present in the file team33.py inside src directory. We have also committed different versions of our bot named as v1.py, v2.py, v3.py, v4.py, v5.py, v6.py, v7.py, v8.py and v9.py.
- The other .pyc files in src directory are of other teams from the tournament.
- To match up two bots, import the classes from the respective .pyc files into the file simulator.py.
- Near the end of the file simulator.py, add another option and create objects, obj1 and obj2 of the two Bot classes. obj1 is for Player 1 and obj2 is for Player 2. Create instances of the Bot classes appropriately.
- Run command: python3 simulator.py
- Choose newly added option by entering appropriate number.
- Enjoy the game!

### Algorithm:
- Refer to Intermediate Report.pdf for a brief idea of our Bot's Algorithm.
- You may refer to the code as well.
- Further details of Algorithm will be explained only on personal request to the Authors.
